# nautobot-eox-notices

A plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot).

## Installation

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip

```shell
pip install nautobot-eox-notices
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.0.0b1 and higher

To ensure Nautobot EoX Tracker is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-eox-notices` package:

```no-highlight
# echo nautobot-eox-notices >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `configuration.py`

```python
# In your configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["eox_notices"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "eox_notices": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

## Usage

### API

TODO

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:

- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. 

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--nautobot-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and Nautobot to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`
