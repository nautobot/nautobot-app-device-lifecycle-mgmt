# CVE Tracking

The CVE Tracking portion of the plugin provides two additional objects - CVE objects and Vulnerability objects.

## CVE objects

A CVE object can be used to record Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as well as any detailed information that is useful to track about them such as publish date, severity, CVSS scores and more. CVE objects can be used individually, but they can then be [associated](#software-association) to one or many Software objects via a [Relationship](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/relationship/).

When creating a CVE object, the following fields are available. Fields in **bold** are mandatory.

| Field | Description |
| -- | -- |
| **Name** | The name of the CVE |
| **Published Date** | Date when the CVE was published |
| **Link** | The URL that the CVE details were obtained from |
| Status | The current status of the CVE (requires a [Status object](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/status/) to be created and associated to the CVE model) |
| Description | The description of the CVE |
| Severity | The severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical) of the CVE |
| CVSS Base Score | The Base (v1) Common Vulnerability Scoring System of the CVE |
| CVSSv2 Score | The CVSSv2 Score |
| CVSSv3 Score | The CVSSv3 Score |
| Fix | The software fix (if available) for the CVE |
| Comments | Any additional comments or details about the CVE |
| Tags | Arbitrary [tag objects](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/tag/) that can be applied to this CVE |

!!! note
    In addition to these standard fields, you can also add one or more [Custom Fields](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/customfield/) to the model.

### Software Association

As stated previously, you can associate a CVE to one or many [Software objects](./software_lifecycle.md#software-objects). These relationships will present themselves as breadcrumb links on each item's detail view.

Example of a breadcrumb link on a CVE item's view:

## Vulnerability objects

A Vulnerability object is the representation of a discovered relationship between a CVE object, a Software object and a Device (or Inventory Item) object. Vulnerability objects cannot be created manually, but rather they must be generated via a Job. They require the combination of a CVE object that is associated to a Software object **and** that Software object to be associated to a Device or Inventory Item object in order to be discovered and generated. You can think of Vulnerability objects like an attack surface that was found in your infrastructure that must be mitigated (such as upgrading the affected device to a patched software version).

To generate Vulnerability objects you must run the ``Generate Vulnerabilities`` Job that is packaged as part of this plugin. One Vulnerability object will be created for **each** unique combination of CVE/Software/Device and CVE/Software/Inventory Item.

!!! note
    When running the ``Generate Vulnerabilities`` Job, if any unique combinations are found that match an existing Vulnerability object, the Job will not create a duplicate object nor modify the existing object.

### Modifying or Removing Vulnerability objects

After a Vulnerability object has been generated, the CVE, Software, Device and Inventory Item fields on that object cannot be modified, however the following fields may be modified (individually or in bulk).

| Field | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Status | The current status of the Vulnerability (requires a [Status object](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/status/) to be created and associated to the Vulnerability model) |
| Tags | Arbitrary [tag objects](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/tag/) that can be applied to this CVE |

!!! note
    In addition to these standard fields, you can also add one or more [Custom Fields](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/models/extras/customfield/) to the model.

As was stated previously, running the ``Generate Vulnerabilities`` Job will not modify (or delete) any existing Vulnerability objects - **even if the associations that existed previously no longer exist**. You do have the ability to delete one or more Vulnerability objects via the GUI or API. In addition to manually removing a Vulnerability, if any CVE, Software, Device or Inventory Item objects are removed, any Vulnerability objects that reference the deleted items will also be removed automatically.
