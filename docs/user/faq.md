# Frequently Asked Questions

Q:  Can Device Lifecycle plugin integrate directly with Cisco End of Sale/Support `EoX` api?
A:  Although not natively built in to the plugin at this time, this can be achieved by writing a Nautobot Job that interacts with the Cisco EoX api. 

Q:  Does this plugin support integration with other vendors hardware/software api's such as Juniper, Palo Alto, Aruba, Arista, etc...?
A:  Not at this time, however, the maintainers would love to hear what you would like to see.  If you work at a networking vendor and would like to see your api's integrated to this plugin, please reach out to the maintainers.
