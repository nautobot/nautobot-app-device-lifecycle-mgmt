# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can Device Lifecycle plugin integrate directly with Cisco End of Sale/Support `EoX` API?

Although not natively built in to the plugin at this time, this can be achieved by writing a Nautobot Job that interacts with the Cisco EoX API. 

## Does this plugin support integration with other vendor's hardware/software API's such as Juniper, Palo Alto, Aruba, Arista, etc...?

Not at this time, however, the maintainers would love to hear what you would like to see.  If you work at a networking vendor and would like to see your API's integrated to this plugin, please reach out to the maintainers.
