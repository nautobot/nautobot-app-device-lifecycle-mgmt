# Frequently Asked Questions

### **"Can Device Lifecycle plugin integrate directly with Cisco End of Sale/Support `EoX` API?"**
#### Answer:  
Although not natively built in to the plugin at this time, this can be achieved by writing a Nautobot Job that interacts with the Cisco EoX API. 

### **"Does this plugin support integration with other vendors hardware/software API's such as Juniper, Palo Alto, Aruba, Arista, etc...?"**
#### Answer:  
Not at this time, however, the maintainers would love to hear what you would like to see.  If you work at a networking vendor and would like to see your API's integrated to this plugin, please reach out to the maintainers.
